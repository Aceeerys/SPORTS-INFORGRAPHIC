      <ol>
        <li>Each of the 14 small pits gets 7 shells,The two big end holes (your and your opponent’s “head”) remain empty..</li>
        <li>Flip a coin or agree on who starts.</li>
        <li>On your turn, pick up all the shells from one of your own 7 pits.</li>
        <li>Move clockwise, drop one shell into each following pit — including your own head, but skipping your opponent’s head.</li>
        <li>If the last shell lands in your head, you get another turn.</li>
        <li>If the last shell lands in an empty pit on your side, and the opposite pit on your opponent’s side has shells, you capture all shells from the opponent’s pit and your own last shell place them into your head.</li>
        <li>If the last shell lands in a non-empty pit, you pick up all shells from that pit and continue moving clockwise, this is called a "relay."</li>
        <li>The game ends when all 7 pits on one player's side are empty.</li>
        <li>The player who still has shells on their side puts them all into their own head.</li>
        <li>Count all shells in each player's head, The player with the most shells wins</li>

      <h2>HISTORY OF SUNGKA</h2>
      <img src="splay.jpg" alt="History of Sungka" class="section-image" />
      <p>Sungka is an ancient Filipino game with a history dating back to the 17th century. Originally called Kunggit, it was first described by the Jesuit priest Father José Sanchez in his dictionary of the Bisaya language (Cebuano) in 1692. Traditionally played by women, it is played on a wooden board shaped like a boat called a sungkaan or sungkahan.</p>
